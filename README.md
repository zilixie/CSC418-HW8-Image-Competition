Because of the limitation of 5MB submission on Markus, source.zip include all my works on codes. A full source including lib (Eigen, etc.) is in the GitHub link below:

My work of this image competition assignment is based on our HW2 and Perlin-noise algorithm. In this assignment I use this algorithm to create various textures such as earth surface, wood texture, fur-like carpet and wallpaper. 

## How to run
